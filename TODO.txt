TODO: Count up algorithm
TODO: Potential problem with priority - It might be easier for the short groups to get more priority?
TODO: Wants hosts to have the closest average amount of participants

Future ideas 

----------------------------------
DONE: Sort most recommended group/groups to least recommended group/groups 
DONE: Save all accepted groups and send a GET request for the stored groups
DONE: Store values in csv file
DONE: Use two itertools.comb and match with accepted group
DONE: Faster to make algorithm straight from accepted groups
