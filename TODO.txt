TODO: Count up algorithm
TODO: Potential problem with priority - It might be easier for the short groups to get more priority?
TODO: Wants hosts to have the closest average amount of participants
TODO: Store values in csv file

Future ideas 
TODO: Sort most recommended group/groups to least recommended group/groups 
TODO: Save all accepted groups and send a GET request for the stored groups

----------------------------------

DONE: Use two itertools.comb and match with accepted group
DONE: Faster to make algorithm straight from accepted groups
